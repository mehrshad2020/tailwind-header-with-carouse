# Responsive  Header with Tailwind CSS

A modern, responsive  website header built with Tailwind CSS that changes its background image when clicking on destination cards.

## Features

- Fully responsive header adapting to all screen sizes
- Interactive destination cards that change the header background when clicked
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Mobile menu for smaller screens
- Horizontal scrolling carousel with navigation buttons
- Built with Tailwind CSS for styling

## Files

- `index.html` - Main HTML structure
- `styles.css` - Custom CSS styles and Tailwind directives
- `main.js` - JavaScript functionality for the header
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The header allows users to:

1. Click on any destination card to change the header background
2. Navigate through the destination cards using the arrow buttons
3. Access the mobile menu on smaller screens

## How It Works

When a destination card is clicked, JavaScript retrieves the image URL from the card's `data-bg` attribute and applies it to the header's background, creating a smooth transition effect.

## Customization

You can easily customize this header by:

- Changing images in the destination cards and their corresponding backgrounds
- Modifying the color scheme in the Tailwind classes
- Adding or removing navigation items
- Adjusting the responsive breakpoints
